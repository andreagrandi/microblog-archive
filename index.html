			 <p>In the past couple of days I was having this annoying <strong>issue</strong> while trying to <strong>pull a model from Ollama</strong>: I was running the command <code>ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b</code>, it was downloading something like 4-5% of the model and then the <strong>connection was reset</strong>, the client was ‚Äúcrashing‚Äù and <strong>it always restarted from 0%</strong>.</p>
<p>It looks like I wasn‚Äôt alone: <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/8406">https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/8406</a></p>

			 <p>In the last couple of days I finally had the chance to test <strong>Copilot Edit</strong> (the multi file editing feature).
I made sure to write proper and detailed specifications and I asked it to write the implementation.</p>
<p>The <strong>good</strong> news? It was able to get it right at the first attempt and I was really impressed. Once the implementation was done, I asked it to also fix the two test files involved: it did it right üéâ</p>
<p>The <strong>bad</strong> news? Thanks to my colleague who did the code review, I realised that I had asked the wrong thing üò≠</p>
<p>The thing I had to implement required way more changes than what I had asked for. I quickly reworked and simplified the code by myself this time, but <strong>for once it wasn&rsquo;t AI fault</strong>!</p>

<p>The second day in Maiorca (I&rsquo;m here for my company annual retreat) started with a very nice breakfast with a wonderful view on the sea.</p>
<p>We had a few sessions during the day (unfortunately I can&rsquo;t talk about them) followed by some relaxing time next to the swimming pool.</p>
<p>The weather is nice and in my spare time I&rsquo;m keeping an eye on the last few things being prepared for the next PyCon Italy.</p>
