			 <p>Trying to brush up a couple of things today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watching a few existing talks about a subject I would like to <strong>give a talk</strong> about (no spoilers yet!)</li>
<li>Reading documentation about <strong>VSCode</strong> extensions for an idea I have (at least I found a good name!)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this while I try to relax after a nice day where I also <strong>trained my dog</strong> a little bit üê∂</p>

			 <p>In a future iteration of GitHub Copilot I expect it to check the errors in CI and automatically propose a fix.</p>
<p>I just did this manually: copy pasting the error back, asking for a fix, the fix was correct, I made the commit, push etc&hellip;</p>
<p>It could be automated with me still in charge to dismiss or accept.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things I usually want to post and which are too small to justify the effort of creating a blog post on my main blog, but they are too big to fit a Mastodon (or Bluesky post), so I think I will start using this micro blog much more!</p>

<p>The second day in Maiorca (I&rsquo;m here for my company annual retreat) started with a very nice breakfast with a wonderful view on the sea.</p>
<p>We had a few sessions during the day (unfortunately I can&rsquo;t talk about them) followed by some relaxing time next to the swimming pool.</p>
<p>The weather is nice and in my spare time I&rsquo;m keeping an eye on the last few things being prepared for the next PyCon Italy.</p>
